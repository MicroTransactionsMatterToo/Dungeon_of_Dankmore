Tutorial: You wake up in a DARK room with no memories. Man who tells you need to kill a demon (very cliché). You go through a few rooms to learn basic movement and controls. You find the demon in a ritual room sees you and fucks you sideways. Drags you into dungeon. You see warlock standing over you, talking to you mockingly. as he utters a curse.

Wake up in the dungeon. Stone room, wooden floors, wooden door (not reinforced)  First multipath: 
1 Brick in the wall that you pull to go through shortcut tunnel (takes you to room 5). 
 2 Unidentified liquid in corner, if you inspect you get “unknown buff/debuff”
3 Main path: wooden door with keyhole - 1 look for key (look through keyhole: see it hanging on a hook, need a stick from in corner to extend reach) 2 break door with rock (in corner). 
NEXT ROOM (2) 
Similar design
There is a corpse on the floor. It looks diseased but is also well equipped. You can loot it and get a debuff or leave it.  The next time you do an action the floor will crumble away revealing a coffin which a skeleton leaps out of. {Combat} After the fight you may choose to loot one bone. You are trapped. Inspecting or looking will reveal a tunnel with no other way out you must go through it.
Hallway (1)
Torches on the walls, no features.
Junction to Hallway (2) and Hallway (3)
Hallway (2)
There is a dead end and a {Trapped} Chest. You may open the chest or walk back. If you do not examine the chest and open it a arrow flies from the wall and damages you for 2 points and the chest locks permanently. Examining it opens it without activating the trap and you get a weak health potion that heals 1 heart-point. Then you backtrack to Hallway (3)
Hallway (3)
You are in the tunnel walking along  when you hear footsteps you may hide in a niche in the wall or face the owners of the footsteps. If you decide to face the owners of the footsteps they are revealed as weak goblins which you fight {combat}. If you hide you avoid the combat and continue to:
Room (3)
In the room is a fat sleeping Ogre and a box you may fight the Ogre, ignore the room or sneak in and steal the box.  Ogre will wake up if you do not use the {sneak} command. INITIATE COMBAT. if you sneak, loot the chest and leave. (Box contains food ((reskinned health potion, trollburgers, rat tail soup, boiled swedish style wobwob.)).
Room (4)
A room containing only a metal spike in the floor. As you come in it says you are fatigued. There is no way out unless you sleep. (teleport to room 5)


Room (5)
Room five upon first look is seemingly empty, but at second glance (or sniff), you notice a strange odour. You see a wooden bowl in the damp corner of the room, (inspect/leave) 
If you smoke it you get the “Baked” buff/debuff.








My (Casper’s) Ideas go here:


Room, on table puzzlebox (bomb) on inspection explodes in face.


Altars- Provide a save point and cure debuffs (also removes buffs to makes it more balanced)
